# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a classic tic-tac-toe game. I've made it playable on mobile devices, so you don't need to switch to desktop view. 
There's a minor bug in the dialog element where pressing ESC twice in Chrome can close it unexpectedly, 
causing the program to break. (You'll notice the buttons spawn again and again if you close dialog with ESC.)
